# Raine's FBZ Intro Jumping
 
includes options to tweak the intro to be like various kinds of intros (Origins, S3C, and a custom one)
also includes an option to load in the S3C night palette, and has full compatibility with [Useott's Original Zone Order](https://gamebanana.com/mods/524374) as far as i know

probably still pretty buggy but at least no rawdata!
